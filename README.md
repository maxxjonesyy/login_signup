# Login_Signup Form

I've been learning PHP recently as I want to use it for industry standard form validation and input handling. The project is pretty self explanatory - user input is sanitised and passwords are hashed before submitting to a MySql backend. Upon retrieval password is decrypted and compared against DB with the username, if successful you will be granted with a "logged in" screen.
